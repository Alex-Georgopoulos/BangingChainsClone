PHP Forms

    the php superglobals $_GET and $_POST are used to collect form-data.

    GET vs POST 
        both create an array that holds key/value pairs, where keys are the names of
        the form controls and vaules are the input from the user
        get is passed tot the current script via URL parameters
        post is passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method. 
        information sent from a form with the get method is visible to everyone.
        information sent from the post method is invisile to others making it the 
        prefered method used by devs
